HDK firmware 01.17.2017

Changes:
. This release includes a bootloader update.
    - The new bootloader will be automatically installed when you call hdk_firmware_update.bat.
    - It is strongly recommended that you perform the firmware update via USB, not wireless.
. Can configure some aspects of the firmware using the JSON file, such as button mappings.
    - This is entirely optional; the firmware defaults are recommended.
    - See document "The JSON File - Firmware."
. Firmware selects the following based upon JSON parameters.
    - HMD vs. Controller mode (mode switch on the HDK is now ignored)
    - Button mapping
    - IMU rate and scale

Fixes:
. Flash red LED on missing JSON file.
. Wireless pairing is more reliable.
. USB detection is more reliable.
. Improve handoff between USB and wireless transport layers.
