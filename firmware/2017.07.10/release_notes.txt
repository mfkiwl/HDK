HDK firmware 07.10.2017

*** Firmware Updates use a new transfer protocol which requires a new 
*** lighthouse_watchman_update tool (lighthouse_watchman_update_20170710.exe) and
*** compatible firmware update files (.fw file types)
*** The tool will be released into the main SteamVR tools directory at a future date.

Changes:
. This release includes bootloader, application, FPGA, and fuel gauge updates
    - Updates should be applied via USB or JTAG, not wirelessly
    - The new bootloader must be installed first
    - Please see update_steps.txt for more information
. Added TS4231 ASIC (e.g. SteamVR Tracking 2.0, Sync-On-Beam) Compatibility
    - Support enabled by setting device HWID to 0x90030006
. Firmware Updates improvements
    - Updates may be sent via the application (default) or bootloader
    - Updates are staged, validated, and applied at reboot for improved reliability
. Internal Power Management improvements
    - Automatically shut off devices at 5% battery life
. General reliability improvements

Fixes:
. Fix issue where wireless devices do not always show in SteamVR
. Numerous Power Manager fixes:
    - Device will gracefully handle missing fuel gauge, charger, or battery
    - Device will properly charge batteries to 100%
    - USB Host & Charger connect/disconnect detection more reliable
. Haptics driver better handles wireless operations
. Button & trackpad driver reliability improvements

Notes:
. Button remapping via the JSON 'firmware_config' section has changed.  Please
  refer to the JSON Firmware Config PDF for more information

HDK firmware 01.17.2017

Changes:
. This release includes a bootloader update.
    - The new bootloader will be automatically installed when you call hdk_firmware_update.bat.
    - It is strongly recommended that you perform the firmware update via USB, not wireless.
. Can configure some aspects of the firmware using the JSON file, such as button mappings.
    - This is entirely optional; the firmware defaults are recommended.
    - See document "The JSON File - Firmware."
. Firmware selects the following based upon JSON parameters.
    - HMD vs. Controller mode (mode switch on the HDK is now ignored)
    - Button mapping
    - IMU rate and scale

Fixes:
. Flash red LED on missing JSON file.
. Wireless pairing is more reliable.
. USB detection is more reliable.
. Improve handoff between USB and wireless transport layers.

HDK firmware 10.27.2016

This release includes a new bootloader.  It is recommended that you use JTAG to flash the new bootloader onto your devices, if you have access to a JTAG programmer.  The Segger J-Link Base is recommended.

Fixes:
. Radio pairing more reliable
. Wireless JSON upload works
. Wireless haptic pulses work
. Improve radio reliability (change SPI timings)
. Don't erase JSON on firmware update
. Report radio firmware version to lighthouse_console
. Tune IMU sensitivity for HMD vs Controller mode
. Fix assert()s when host PC disconnects / reconnects
. Better detection of USB plug / unplug
. Better power-on sequence (avoid brown-out if battery dead / missing)
. Don't send phantom trigger events to SteamVR when Hall sensor unpopulated
. Decrease IMU latency and IMU / optical drift
. Resize application region by 8 KB (fix overlap with calibration data)
. Bootloader: don't hang on partition table updates
